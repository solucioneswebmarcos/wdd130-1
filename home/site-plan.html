      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>I am Marcos Arias, I live in Spain, I am originally from Argentina. I am 47 years old and I have been happily married for 25 years and I have 2 children. I am a determined person and I have the determination to achieve my goals and the fact that I am studying at my age is not because I have difficulty learning, all my attention was focused on achieving provide for my family in a country free of crisis and insecurity and now that my children are grown I can focus on developing my talents</p> 
      <img src="images/wireframe1.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>         
        I am a student at Brigham Young University in Idaho and to date I have completed work in the following languages:
Python, C#, HTML, CSS.
Currently, I continue to increase my coding skills by practicing and carrying out different development projects by learning different programming languages.

      </p>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>         
        On this page you can find a summary of the work as it is being carried out and you can also make inquiries about contracting and request quotes.
        For now, this page cannot have all the content I would like because I am just at the beginning of my career as a developer, but the idea is that it can have a whole section with the portfolio of work and a whole section for hiring and consulting.
        So the idea is a commercial page but today it is only in draft for a future where I have more knowledge.
        In order to request a quote you must provide the following information:
        the objective of the company for which the page is created
